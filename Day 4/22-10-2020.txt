		CONCURRENCY and IPC
		
Parallel Computation:
	std::thread
	std::async
	
Threads:
 * Resource sharing (expcept stack)
 * Concurrent execution
 
Task driven Parallelism - Each task does its own work with different data.
Data driven Parallelism - All taks does works on same data.
				(Eg. parallel sum of large array - pthread)
				
				
				
std::thread constructor takes:
	 1. Normal Functions
	 2. Lambdas expressions
	 3. Binded functions
	 4. Function objects (Any class with over loaded function object is ---)
	 5. Member functions (hint: std::bind)
	 	
TODO:
	1. parallel sum of large array
	2. Bus locking	
	
	3. std::condition_variables
	4. std::async
	5. std::future
	6. std::promise
	
Activity:
	psot read of covered topics (thread,mutex,locks etc)
	pre read of next topics
	coding tasks
	file handling, Namespaces (if pending)
	Exception handling(give a try)
	
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		IPC
  1. Race Conditon: Resource being shared by multiple threads and updating it leads to crash(Example 6 for Race condition problem)
  	Solution
  		Keep the critical section of code  
  		Entry Section(Decision Making: 1st person-go/ 2nd person - wait)
  		Exit Section (Indication to other entry section for entry of 1person)
  		
  2. Mutual Exclusion - Only one process/threads enters into critical section
  	SOlution:
  		Semaphores (no c++ support)
  		Mutex
  		Spinlocks (no c++ support)
  		Atomic variables (c++ objects)
  		  	
  3. Signalling/Synchronization
  	Solution:
  		Semaphores (no c++ support)
  		Condition variables
  		
  		
  
 atomic_flag:		
  test_and_set  locks memory-> it uses XCHG and SWP
  reg=0
  T1							T2
  while(XCHG(reg,1));//entry				while(XCHG(reg,1));//busy loop
  									   // spinning   
  	//critical section					//critical section
  reg =0 //exit					reg =0 //exit
	 		
NOTE: Busy loop based solutions like spin lock are meanin for Symtric Multicore Process (SMP) only
